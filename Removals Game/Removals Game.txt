Alice got a permutation a1,a2,…,an
 of [1,2,…,n]
, and Bob got another permutation b1,b2,…,bn
 of [1,2,…,n]
. They are going to play a game with these arrays.

In each turn, the following events happen in order:

Alice chooses either the first or the last element of her array and removes it from the array;
Bob chooses either the first or the last element of his array and removes it from the array.
The game continues for n−1
 turns, after which both arrays will have exactly one remaining element: x
 in the array a
 and y
 in the array b
.

If x=y
, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. Find which player will win if both players play optimally.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤3⋅105
).

The next line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤n
, all ai
 are distinct) — the permutation of Alice.

The next line contains n
 integers b1,b2,…,bn
 (1≤bi≤n
, all bi
 are distinct) — the permutation of Bob.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all n
 does not exceed 3⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print Alice
; otherwise, print Bob
.
