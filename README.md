# Codeforces Solutions by Muhammad Rehman

Welcome to my repository for Codeforces problem solutions! Here, I share my solutions to competitive programming problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/Muhammad_Rehman), where I actively participate in contests and practice a wide range of problems to enhance my skills.

## ðŸŒŸ About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing my solutions to various problems on Codeforces. Each solution is coded in a clean and efficient manner, reflecting my approach to problem-solving and competitive programming. The problems cover a range of difficulty levels, from beginner to advanced, across multiple topics.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Problems/**: This folder contains subdirectories for each problem solved, named with the problem code (e.g., `A1000`) or title. Each subdirectory includes:
  - `solution.cpp` or `solution.py` - The solution code for the problem.
  - `README.md` - A brief explanation of the problem, approach, and solution.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run any solution locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rehmanmusharaf/codeforces.git
