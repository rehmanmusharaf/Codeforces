Two players, Alice and Bob, are playing a game. They have n
 piles of stones, with the i
-th pile initially containing ai
 stones.

On their turn, a player can choose any pile of stones and take any positive number of stones from it, with one condition:

let the current number of stones in the pile be x
. It is not allowed to take from the pile a number of stones y
 such that the greatest common divisor of x
 and y
 is not equal to 1
.
The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally (that is, if a player has a strategy that allows them to win, no matter how the opponent responds, they will win). Alice goes first.

Determine who will win.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

the first line contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤3⋅105
);
the second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤107
).
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n
 across all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output Alice if Alice wins, or Bob if Bob wins.
